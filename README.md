## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The project has the following:
 - data (directory with 'UCI HAR Dataset' directory)
 - results (directory where Tidy Data from step 5 is exported as a file)
 - run_analyis.R (code)
 - CodeBook.md (step by step details of the code)
 
 
 ### Running the code
